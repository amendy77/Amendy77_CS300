# SNHU-CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    
    This course covered several data types, including linked lists, hash tables, 
    and binary trees, as well as how to use them appropriately in applications.     
    
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    
   I made an effort to comprehend the relative advantages and disadvantages of each data format and to use them 
   when their advantages outweighed their disadvantages.
    
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

    I resolved any problems by seeking at sample applications or the official documentation for the technique.
     Alternatively, on occasion, I would create a short, simple prototype code part and then expand it 
     when the reasoning got more intricate.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

    My perspective on algorithmic design and performance has changed significantly as a result of the big-O 
    investigation.It also made me realize that one of my weaknesses in some of my 
    prospective designs is that I do not think recursively.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

     All of these components, in my opinion, result from practice. I've written enough file streams that I can now utilize
      as a prototype thanks to a common function. I may even develop some of the other components
       I frequently use into libraries.
